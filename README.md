# The-Empathy-Oasis
A mental health website built for United Hacks 2023

## Inspiration
With academic pressures, social expectations, and personal responsibilities, mental health issues have largely increased nowadays, especially among university students. However, people may find it difficult to seek help due to stigmas and other concerns. A counselling platform is essential as many people may not have access to them due to geographic location, time constraints, or cost. By providing an accessible and affordable counselling platform, more people may be encouraged to seek help and receive the support they need as the platform can provide resources and guidance to help individuals manage their mental health and reduce their mental strain.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Complicated URL routing in Django due to too many webpages
2. Getting familiar with GitHub
3. Getting more familiar with Django database
4. Uploading profile picture using Pillow module
5. Setting authentication and authorization for different types of users

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is our first hackathon, and it is our first time building a fully functionable website with database. We are quite happy with the outcome of our first hackathon project, especially considering the relatively short timeframe we had to build it. It is a user-friendly and convenient website that can provide invaluable guidance and support to individuals struggling with mental health challenges.
